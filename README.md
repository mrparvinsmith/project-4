# Project 4
[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/VrvPHFuB/project-4#)  

This project will be a transportaion app that provides real-time information on public parking availability, proximity and schedules of trains and buses, and potentially (but probably not) bike share stations. It will also let users save their preferred garages, stations, and metro routes.  

I will be accessing [an api for parking](https://parking.api.smgov.net/) and [an api for the metro](http://developer.metro.net/). 

This app will be made using the MEAN stack.
